# cinemagraphic-wallpaper

Loads a few favorite cinemagraphic of mine and stretches it full screen. If you combine this with a utility to display a webpage, you can have animated wallpaper. This uses MP4s from Imgur, and you can supply your own Ids of your favorites in the code.

Point your browser here for an example, and keep reloading:
