Cinemagraphic Wallpaper
=======================

Intro
-----

Loads a few favorite cinemagraphic of mine and stretches it full screen. If you combine this with a utility to display a webpage as wallpaper, then you have animated wallpaper. This uses MP4s from Imgur, and you can supply your own Ids of your favorites in the code.
